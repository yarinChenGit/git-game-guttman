Amazing - you made it to `level 3`!
Now, let's dig a bit deeper and take a trip down memory lane.

In the middle of the year, we learned 2 machine learning algorithms - `knn` and `kmeans`.
Merge the branch with name of the classification algorithm to this branch. If chosen correctly - you will get a merge conflict.
Solve it, show it to us and you will get the next clue.

## If you do not have merge conflicts

show it to us and we will help to get the branch back to the original version.
